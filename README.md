# Typescript

Now we gonna learn Typescript initial concepts, and apply them on projects that we already developed until this point.

## How to run

OBS.: This project is just an example about how to add types on variables in Typescript, but you can create distribution files following the steps below

1. `git clone` this repository
2. Make sure you have `yarn` installed
3. Inside project folder run the command `$ yarn` to download dependencies
4. Create `dist` folder running `$ yarn tsc`
5. Run the app with `$ node dist/index.js `

### keep coding!
